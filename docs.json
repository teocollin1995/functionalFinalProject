Matrix and Vector are defined in expression, but tools for manipulating them (e.g. though maps, dot products, norms, row operations, determiants, eigen values, and what not) are stored here. \n\nIn order to allow you to accomplish these operations in full generality, we have created a Space type where you define zero, one, addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and from real. Once you supply this for a particular type, you can specalize all the functions that require any of these operations. Any function that did not require these operations can be used for any Matrix a or Vector a.\n\nNote that for all functions take rows and cols, the rows are alwalys given first and then the cols. So for unsafeGetM : Int -> Int -> Matrix a -> a , the first argument is a row, the second is the column. \n\nTODO:\n\n# Space \n@docs Space, complexSpace\n\n# Builders\n@docs vector, matrix, rowVector, colVector\n\n# Dimensions \n@docs dimV, nrows, ncols\n\n# Special Matrices\n@docs same, identity, isIdentity, permMatrix, allPermutationMatricies, isTriangular, isSquare\n\n# List Conversions\n@docs vectorFromList, fromList, fromLists, toList, toLists, toVector\n\n# Accessing \n@docs unsafeGetM, unsafeGetRow, unsafeGetCol, unsafeGetDiag\n\n# Setting\n@docs set, setRow, setCol\n\n# Mapping\n@docs map, indexedMap, mapVector, indexedMapVector\n\n# Extensions\n@docs extendMatrix, extendMatrixTo\n\n# Submatricies and Blocks\n@docs submatrix, splitBlocks, verticalJoin, horizontalJoin, minor, minors\n\n# Single Matrix, Row Operations, and Single Vector Operations \n@docs transpose, scaleVector, scaleMatrix, scaleRow, combineRow, switchRow, rowReduce, gaussianEliminationForward, gaussianEliminationBackwards\n\n# Operations on Two Matricies or Two Vectors\n@docs elementWise, vectorMap2, dotProd, matrixMult\n\n# Matrix properties\n@docs  invert, invertable, trace, diagProd, simpleDet\n\n# Numerical Linear Algebra \n@docs eigenValues, eigenVectors\n",
